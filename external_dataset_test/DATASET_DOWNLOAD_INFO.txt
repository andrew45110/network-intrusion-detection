DATASET DOWNLOAD - NO MANUAL WORK REQUIRED!
===========================================

IMPORTANT: You DO NOT need to download datasets manually!

The download_datasets.py script handles everything automatically.


HOW IT WORKS:
=============

1. Run the script:
   
   python download_datasets.py

2. Select a dataset from the menu (1-4):

   [1] CIC-IDS2017      - ~50MB  (DDoS attacks)
   [2] UNSW-NB15        - ~200MB (Modern attacks)
   [3] NSL-KDD          - ~20MB  (Classic benchmark)
   [4] CSE-CIC-IDS2018  - ~100MB (Realistic traffic)

3. The script automatically:
   
   [+] Downloads from Kaggle
   [+] Extracts the files
   [+] Places them in ./external_data/
   [+] Tells you which file to use

4. That's it! You're ready to run:
   
   python test_external.py


REQUIREMENTS:
=============

For automatic downloading, you need:

1. Kaggle API credentials (one-time setup):
   
   a. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/settings
   b. Click "Create New API Token"
   c. Save kaggle.json to:
      Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\kaggle.json
      Linux/Mac: ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

2. kagglehub package:
   
   pip install kagglehub


ALTERNATIVE - MANUAL DOWNLOAD:
===============================

If you prefer manual downloading OR if Kaggle API setup fails:

1. Visit one of these URLs:
   
   - CIC-IDS2017: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cicdataset/cicids2017
   - UNSW-NB15: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15
   - NSL-KDD: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd
   - CSE-CIC-IDS2018: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv

2. Click "Download" button

3. Extract the ZIP file

4. Copy the CSV file(s) to:
   
   ./external_data/

5. Run test_external.py


RECOMMENDED FIRST TEST:
=======================

Dataset: CIC-IDS2017
Why: Most similar to your InSDN training data
Size: ~50MB (smallest/fastest)
Method: Run download_datasets.py and select option [1]


SUMMARY:
========

Question: "Do I have to download the datasets myself?"
Answer:  NO! The script does it automatically.

Just run:
  python download_datasets.py
  
Select a dataset, wait for download, then run:
  python test_external.py

The script handles all the downloading, extraction, and file placement!
