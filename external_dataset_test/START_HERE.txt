WELCOME!

This folder contains everything you need to test your trained InSDN model
on completely new external datasets. This is CRITICAL to validate that
your 99.96% training accuracy wasn't just overfitting!


WHAT YOU'LL DO IN 3 STEPS:

   Step 1: Verify Setup        →  python verify_setup.py
   Step 2: Download Dataset    →  python download_datasets.py
   Step 3: Test Your Model     →  python test_external.py


FASTEST START (5 minutes):

   1. Open your terminal in this folder
   2. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
   3. Run: python download_datasets.py (choose option 1)
   4. Run: python test_external.py
   5. Check the ./results/ folder for your results!


DOCUMENTATION:

   • QUICKSTART.md    → 5-minute fast guide
   • README.md        → Complete documentation
   • INDEX.md         → Full file reference
   • verify_setup.py  → Check if ready to test


WHAT YOU GET:

   [+] Test your model on external datasets it's never seen
   [+] Comprehensive evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUC, etc.)
   [+] Beautiful visualizations (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)
   [+] Know if your model truly generalizes or just memorized data


WHY THIS MATTERS:

   Training Accuracy: 99.96% on InSDN dataset
   
   But what about OTHER datasets?
   
   --> 95% on external data? [+] Excellent generalization!
   --> 60% on external data? [-] Model overfit to training data
   
   External testing is the ONLY way to know for sure!


SELF-CONTAINED:

   Everything is in this folder:
   [+] Testing scripts
   [+] Dataset downloader (automatic - no manual downloads needed!)
   [+] Feature mapping (handles mismatches automatically)
   [+] Evaluation metrics
   [+] Visualization generation
   [+] Complete documentation


NEED HELP?

   1. Run: python verify_setup.py (checks your setup)
   2. Read: QUICKSTART.md (5-minute guide)
   3. Read: README.md (complete docs)


STATUS CHECK:

   Before you start, make sure:
   
   [ ] You've trained the model (run notebook.py in parent folder)
   [ ] ../output/final_model.keras exists
   [ ] You have Python 3.8+ installed
   [ ] You have an internet connection (for automatic dataset downloads)
   
   Check by running: python verify_setup.py


RECOMMENDED FIRST TEST:

   Dataset: CIC-IDS2017 (DDoS attacks)
   Size: ~50MB
   Download: Automatic via download_datasets.py (just select option 1)
   Why: Most similar to InSDN, best for first test
